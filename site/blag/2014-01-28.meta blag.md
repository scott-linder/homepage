Bugfix today in the blog package added a new method, `NewBlogSimple` which
assumes some default configuration options:

```prettyprint
blog.NewBlogSimple("name", subRouter)
```

In order to easily share configurations between multiple blog instances I'm
considering adding a Config struct which can be reused over multiple calls
to `NewBlogFromCfg`, or something.
